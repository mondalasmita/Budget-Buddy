Budget-Buddy is my take on a simple yet powerful expense tracker website. I built it to help people like me keep tabs on where their money's going without the headache of complicated spreadsheets or confusing apps.

## What's Budget-Buddy All About?

Ever felt like your money just vanishes into thin air? Yeah, me too. That's why I created Budget-Buddy. It's straightforward, easy to use, and gets the job done without any fuss.

### Key Features

- **Quick Expense Logging**: Add your expenses on the go. It's as easy as typing in a text message.
- **Categorization**: Sort your spending into categories. Find out if you're spending more on tacos or tech (no judgment either way).
- **Visual Reports**: See your spending habits at a glance with some nifty charts and graphs.
- **Budget Setting**: Set budget goals and watch your progress. It's like a game, but the high score is saving money.
- **Responsive Design**: Use it on your computer, tablet, or phone. Your budget follows you everywhere (in a good way).

## Why I Made This

Look, I'm no financial guru. I just got tired of being surprised by my bank statement at the end of each month. Budget-Buddy is my solution to keep track of my spending without feeling like I need an accounting degree.

## How to Use It

1. Sign up (it's free, because who wants to pay to save money?)
2. Start logging your expenses
3. Check out your spending trends
4. Set some budget goals
5. Watch your savings grow (hopefully)



## What's Next?

I've got some ideas to make Budget-Buddy even better:
-  Currency conversion for my jet-setting friends
-  Bill reminders (because adulting is hard)
-  Integration with bank accounts (securely, of course)
